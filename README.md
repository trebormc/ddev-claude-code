# ddev-claude-code

A DDEV add-on that runs [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (Anthropic's official CLI) in a dedicated container for AI-powered **Drupal** development.

> **Part of [DDEV AI Workspace](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ai-workspace)** — a modular ecosystem of DDEV add-ons for AI-powered Drupal development. Install the full stack with one command: `ddev add-on get trebormc/ddev-ai-workspace`

## Why this add-on?

There are [several DDEV add-ons for Claude Code](https://addons.ddev.com/?search=claude) already available. This one was built for a specific use case and differs from the others in a few key ways:

- **Multi-container orchestration.** Designed to work as part of a larger AI workspace where the Claude container connects to sibling containers: a Playwright container for browser testing, a Beads container for task tracking, and access to the web container for running drush, composer, phpunit, and phpstan directly against Drupal.
- **Minimal and focused.** Does not bundle MCPs or extra tooling inside the container. External tools (Playwright, task tracking) run in their own dedicated containers, keeping the Claude container lightweight.
- **TUI wrapper with tab titles.** Includes a terminal wrapper that sets custom tab titles (`project-name - task label`), which is useful when juggling multiple agents or projects across several terminals.
- **Desktop notifications.** Supports optional host notifications (via [ai-notify-bridge](https://github.com/trebormc/ai-notify-bridge)) when sessions or tasks complete.
- **Autonomous execution ready.** Pairs with [ddev-ralph](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ralph) for autonomous task loops (planning, executing, and closing tasks overnight).

If you need a standalone Claude Code container without the multi-container setup, one of the [other add-ons](https://addons.ddev.com/?search=claude) may be a better fit.

## Quick Start

The **recommended way** to install this add-on is through the [DDEV AI Workspace](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ai-workspace), which installs all tools and dependencies with a single command:

```bash
ddev add-on get trebormc/ddev-ai-workspace
ddev restart
ddev claude-code  # or: ddev cc
```

### Standalone installation

If you only need Claude Code without the rest of the workspace, you can install it individually. This requires familiarity with the DDEV add-on ecosystem and its dependencies:

```bash
ddev add-on get trebormc/ddev-claude-code
ddev restart
ddev claude-code  # or: ddev cc
```

This automatically installs the required dependencies:
- [ddev-agents-sync](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-agents-sync): auto-syncs AI agents from git (provides CLAUDE.md)
- [ddev-ai-ssh](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ai-ssh): SSH access to web container
- [ddev-beads](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-beads): task tracking
- [ddev-playwright-mcp](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-playwright-mcp): browser automation

## Prerequisites

- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/) >= v1.24.10
- An Anthropic API key or OAuth session

## Authentication

Run `ddev claude-code` and follow the prompts. Claude Code handles OAuth and API key authentication natively. No custom commands or manual file editing needed.

Credentials are stored in a shared directory on the host (`~/.ddev/claude-code/` by default), so you only need to authenticate **once**. All your DDEV projects share the same session automatically. Credentials persist across `ddev restart`, new projects, and machine reboots.

## Configuration

After installation, environment variables are in `.ddev/.env.claude-code`:

```bash
# Shared config directory (credentials, settings, and session data).
# Shared across ALL DDEV projects. Change only if you need a custom location.
HOST_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=${HOME}/.ddev/claude-code

# Timezone
TZ=UTC
```

> **Note:** `HOST_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` must point to an existing directory. The installer creates `~/.ddev/claude-code/` automatically. If you change this value, make sure the directory exists before running `ddev restart`.

### Permissions

The installer creates a default `settings.json` with `bypassPermissions` mode. All permission prompts are disabled since Claude Code runs inside an isolated DDEV container.

To change this, edit `~/.ddev/claude-code/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions"
  }
}
```

Available modes: `bypassPermissions` (default, no prompts), `auto` (smart classifier), `acceptEdits` (auto-approve edits only), `default` (prompt for everything).

Since it lives in the shared config directory, permission changes apply to all DDEV projects.

```

Claude Code communicates with the web container via SSH (`ssh web`), giving it full CLI access to drush, composer, phpunit, phpstan, and any other tool in the web container. SSH keys are auto-generated per project in `.ddev/.agent-ssh-keys/`. Playwright MCP is accessed over HTTP for browser automation and visual testing.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ddev claude-code` | Start Claude Code interactive session |
| `ddev cc` | Alias for `ddev claude-code` |
| `ddev claude-code tui` | Start interactive session (same as above) |
| `ddev claude-code tui Fix login bug` | Start interactive session with a custom tab title |
| `ddev claude-code shell` | Open a bash shell in the container |
| `ddev claude-code <command>` | Run any command in the container |

### Tab title for multi-project workflows

When working on multiple DDEV projects at the same time, it can be hard to tell which terminal belongs to which project. The `tui` subcommand sets the terminal tab title to **`project-name - custom text`**, so you can identify each terminal at a glance.

The project name (`DDEV_SITENAME`) is always included automatically. If you add extra text after `tui`, it appears as a label. Useful for describing the task you are working on in that terminal.

```bash
# Tab title: "mysite - Claude Code"
ddev claude-code

# Tab title: "mysite - Claude Code"  (explicit tui, same result)
ddev claude-code tui

# Tab title: "mysite - Fix login redirect bug"
ddev claude-code tui Fix login redirect bug

# Tab title: "mysite - TASK-42 migrate users"
ddev claude-code tui TASK-42 migrate users
```

This way, if you have three terminals open (two projects, two tasks), each tab shows exactly where you are and what you are doing.

### Shell Helpers

Inside the container (via `ddev claude-code shell`), these helper functions are available:

| Helper | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `drush` | Run drush commands in the web container |
| `composer` | Run composer in the web container |
| `phpunit` | Run PHPUnit tests in the web container |
| `phpstan` | Run PHPStan analysis in the web container |
| `web-exec` | Execute any command in the web container |
| `web-shell` | Open an interactive shell in the web container |
| `bd` | Run Beads task tracking commands |

## Agents and CLAUDE.md

When [ddev-agents-sync](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-agents-sync) is installed (auto-installed as dependency), Claude Code automatically gets:

- **10 specialized agents** in `.claude/agents/` (drupal-dev, code-review, etc.)
- **CLAUDE.md** with Drupal development instructions in the project root
- **Rules and skills** for Drupal development workflows

Agent `.md` files use model tokens (like `${MODEL_CHEAP}`) that are resolved to Claude Code aliases (like `haiku`) during sync. See [drupal-ai-agents](https://github.com/trebormc/drupal-ai-agents) for the full list of agents, tokens, and customization options.

You can place your own `CLAUDE.md` in your Drupal project root. It won't be overwritten if it already exists.

### Customizing agents and models

To add private agents or change which models agents use, edit `.ddev/.env.agents-sync`:

```bash
# Add a private repo with custom agents or model overrides
AGENTS_REPOS=https://github.com/trebormc/drupal-ai-agents.git,https://github.com/your-org/private-agents.git
```

See [Model Token System](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-agents-sync#model-token-system) for details on changing agent models globally.

## Desktop Notifications (optional)

Claude Code can send desktop notifications when sessions finish. First, install the [ai-notify-bridge](https://github.com/trebormc/ai-notify-bridge) on your host (one-time setup):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trebormc/ai-notify-bridge/main/install.sh | bash
```

Notification hooks are pre-configured in `settings.json` when you install the add-on. They include the project name and TUI task label automatically. Example notification title: `[mysite] Fix login bug`.

If you already have a `settings.json` from a previous install, add the hooks manually. See the [install.yaml](install.yaml) for the exact hook configuration.

If the bridge is not installed or not running, the curl call fails silently with no impact on Claude Code.

## Autonomous Execution

For autonomous task execution (overnight runs), see [ddev-ralph](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ralph).

## Uninstallation

```bash
ddev add-on remove ddev-claude-code
ddev restart
```
